    <h2>Getting My First Computer</h2>
    <p>When I got my first computer, I had the business guy install it in my room where it was going to be used. It had <strong>Windows 3.1</strong> on it. I was able to do just a few things on it. It had Notepad, WordPad, games on CDs, and preinstalled games and programs to use.</p>

    <h2>Internet Service Provider</h2>
    <p>The internet service provider we had was <strong>A. M. E. R. I. C. A. O. L. I. N. E.</strong> (purposely misspelled). That year in my life, I never knew about higher speeds than dial-up. I also didn’t know anything about what a "speedy connection" even was.</p>

    <h2>Windows Evolution</h2>
    <p>Over the course of about 15 or 16 years, <strong>Windows 3.1</strong> went from Windows 3.1 to these:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Windows 95</li>
        <li>Windows 98</li>
        <li>Windows Millennium</li>
        <li>Windows 2000</li>
        <li>Windows XP</li>
        <li>Windows Vista</li>
        <li>Windows 7</li>
        <li>Windows 8</li>
        <li>Windows 8.1</li>
        <li>Windows 10</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Present Day</h2>
    <p>Now, 15 years later, I’m using Windows 10. The World Wide Web is a lot bigger somehow. If you need to find out anything, you can do it on the web. It has the answer 99 out of 100 times.</p>
