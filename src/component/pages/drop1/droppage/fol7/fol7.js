    <li>A news search page</li>
    <li>A shopping search page</li>
    <li>A videos search page</li>
    <li>A flights search page</li>
    <li>Alexa, Siri, or "Hey Google"</li>
    <li>An investing search page</li>
    <li>As huge of a collection of webpages that it has now, so that you can get even more answers you look for</li>
