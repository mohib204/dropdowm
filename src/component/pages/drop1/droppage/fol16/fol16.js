            <li>2. The mouse connection was the same as the keyboard connection.</li>
            <li>3. The keyboard connection today (2022) is a wireless USB receiver that plugs into the computer. The mouse is wireless and has a battery that receives the transmission and shows the cursor on the screen.</li>
            <li>4. The keyboard also works the same way, but it uses 3 batteries, while the mouse uses 1.</li>
            <li>5. There are USB 2.0 and 3.0 ports.</li>
            <li>6. Ethernet to HDMI and reversed are possible with adapters.</li>
            <li>7. USB to RCA and reversed connections are also available.</li>
