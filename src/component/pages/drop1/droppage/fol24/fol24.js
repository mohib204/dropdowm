        <p className='ssd' ><strong>Dial-up</strong> was a way of connecting to the web through a telephone line. You had a <strong>dial-up modem</strong> that connected your computer to the phone outlet in the wall. Once you picked a service provider, you would have it dial and connect to your zipcode to download a list of business phone numbers. From there, you'd pick the closest number to your city. Then, you'd disconnect and add that number to your modem settings, configuring it to dial whenever you wanted to connect to the web.</p>

        <p className='ssd'>Initially, the connection speed was 28.8 kilobytes per second. After 4 or 5 years, a faster speed of 56 kilobytes per second became available. An update later allowed for 2 phone numbers to be stored in the modem settings. If the first number was busy, the modem would automatically try the second one, improving connectivity.</p>
