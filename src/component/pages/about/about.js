        <p>I’m passionate about building this website and enjoy crafting it on my own. However, I couldn’t have done it without the help of my online friend, who takes care of the more complex tasks. Thanks to their expertise, this website is much more than just simple, interconnected pages—it’s a seamless and thoughtfully designed platform.</p>
